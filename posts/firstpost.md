Hi guys! I am Taylor Bracone from Long Island, New York. I am a junior majoring in Human-Centered Design and Development with a focus in Cybersecurity and a minor in Security Risk Analysis. I have some web development skills already through my previous classes, my job, and an internship. I work as a Research Assistant/ Developer for the College of Information Sciences and Technology to help make lives easier through technological designs. Our goal for the project is to provide more efficient ways to track growth and development, among other things, within the agricultural field. I also did an internship on the project. About my classes, I took IST 256, which is programming for the web class. When I heard about this class, I thought it was a perfect way to further my knowledge. I am interested in web development because it is an essential tool to have in the career field. It opens up new possibilities. Also, I am a person that likes to solve problems and explore the unknown, which provides me the opportunity to do so.
